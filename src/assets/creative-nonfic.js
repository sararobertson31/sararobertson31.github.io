    title: `How Art Becomes Time Travel`,
    subtitle: `The Piazza della Signoria of Florence, An Orchestra, and The Rain`,
    content: `It was evening in Florence, and my three friends and I wandered through a maze of twisting streets in single-file. We had spent the day walking the city, trying and failing to book an entry slot to the Uffizi Gallery (we should have booked weeks earlier), and returning twice to a small gelato shop outside the Basilica of Santa Croce where I’d had the creamiest lemon gelato of my 22 years. Throughout our three days in Florence, I had returned countless times to the Piazza della Signoria, the public plaza outside the Palazzo Vecchio, which had housed the city’s renaissance-era government.
 
    It was not the Palazzo Vecchio that interested me as much as the collection of marble and bronze statues spread throughout the plaza. To the right of the main entrance to Palazzo Vecchio is an exact copy of Michelangelo’s David, in the exact location Michelangelo’s original David stood for centuries before he was moved into the Uffizi Gallery in 1857 to be protected from the elements (namely, pigeons). Standing in front of him, my friends and I discussed in exasperation: his hands are too big—the size of his head. How in the world could he have been considered the perfectly proportioned human form? Still, I felt drawn to David. There, in the hot muggy summer of Florence in 2022, I stood at the base of this 17 foot statue, where centuries prior, the original David had stood, and where thousands of people have stood for centuries, looking up at the same statue.
     
    There are countless other statues in the Piazza della Signoria, some copies, many originals. Most of these statues are housed in the Logia dei Lanzi, an open-air gallery facing the piazza, attached to the outside of the Uffizi Gallery. It is free to visitors, and houses most of the statues in the plaza, including Benvenuto Cellini’s original Perseus, cast in bronze in the 16th century. Perseus stands heroically over the body of Medusa, raising up her severed head as if to display it proudly to the crowd in the Piazza below. Outside the Logia dei Lanzi, around the Piazza della Signoria are a few other statues: Baccio Bandinelli’s Hercules and Cacus, aptly nicknamed by Florentines when it was first placed in the piazza “sack of potatoes,” for Hercules’s enormous, lumpy muscles; Giambologna’s Fountain of Neptune, the largest piece of work in the piazza and another victim of the ruthless Florentine nicknaming, “big white guy” for the marble statue’s extravagant details and comically exaggerated proportions.
    
    My favorite, tucked away in the corner next to the Fountain of Neptune, is a small bronze sculpture, Judith and Holofernes, cast in bronze by Donatello in the fifteenth century. Also a copy (the real one is now housed inside the Palazzo Vecchio), this statue depicts the biblical character, Judith. Living in Bethulia during the Assyrian invasion, Judith snuck into the Assyrian camp and seduced their general, Holofernes. Then, she decapitated him, saving her city from certain destruction. In this statue, Judith stands tall, gripping Holofernes’s head between her legs with her dagger raised above her head. It is the only statue in the plaza depicting both a woman and a man in which the woman has authority, is the subject rather than the object of the sculpture. Judith and Holofernes was originally placed to the left of the main entrance to Palazzo Vecchio but was moved when the male councilmembers complained. The statue is tucked away in the corner, while statues such as Perseus with the decapitated Medusa stands in the official open air gallery. 
     
    All of these statues and their history combine to create a space that expands across time; stepping into the plaza felt like stepping into the Florentine Renaissance. Crowds of people milled about, some rushing past without a second glance, some stopping and staring wide-eyed and jaw-dropped, some (like myself) returning day after day, multiple times a day. This culminated in a point in which I sat in on the ground in the center of the plaza for a few moments during my last few hours in Florence attempting to burn the space into my memory. The visual space, yes, but also the sounds, the smells, the warm breeze and the feeling of passersby rushing around me. Something about the Piazza della Signoria felt outside of time, the same now as it was a century ago and as it would be next summer and the summer after.
        
    All of this is to say, I mused over this space obsessively, trying to learn as much as I could during my three days in Florence. One of these days had faded into that warm, humid evening I began with: my friends and I wove through winding, narrow streets in a single-file line to find ourselves in the Piazza della Signoria, where a huge crowd had gathered, some sitting, others standing, all facing the Logia dei Lanzi where an orchestra had assembled. High school students, we thought, preparing to perform certainly long-practiced music for the lucky 200 or so people who happened to occupy the Piazza della Signoria at that moment. 
    
    We made our way through the crowd and found a spot to sit. The music began: a single cello player, a boy who couldn’t have been more than 17, closed his eyes and drew his bow across the strings to create a high, clear note that cast a wave of silence over a previously murmuring crowd. The violins joined in to add a dizzying harmony, then the trombones emitted a tone that seemed to warm my entire body from my stomach outward. As we sat and listened to the orchestra, the sun sank behind the buildings and cast long shadows over the piazza; warm yellow lights installed at the bases of the statues made them appear to glow against the growing moonlight. My friends and I were silent—the entire crowd was silent—as we shared in this moment, as we listened to music in a space where millions, probably billions, of people had sat or stood or walked through and listened to music, and looked with wonder at great statues, ancient or new, originals or copies, for centuries. And in a space where people will continue to do so, I hope, for centuries.
          
    They played through the sunset. Suddenly, from the night sky, I felt a single raindrop on my head. In an instant, the air was so thick with rain that I couldn’t see ten feet in front of me; still, the orchestra on the Logia dei Lanzi, sheltered from the rain by its roof, played on. I could still see the silhouette of the cellist swaying back and forth over his instrument. The crowd began to murmur again; laughter floated through the air as people stood and stuck out their hands to help up their friends sitting next to them. My friends were getting up. I saw a hand waiting for me, too, but I wanted one more moment before taking it.
        
    The rain was warm. It had soaked through my hair, my clothing. I let it; I wanted it to. I was a Californian, a stranger to warm summer rain in the 21st century. I was also a stranger to ancient and renaissance sculpture; a stranger to orchestras. I wanted every bit of that moment to soak through me: the rain, the orchestra, the statues, and everyone who had ever stood in front of them and felt so young and small in the face of something so old and so persisting. If I hadn’t taken that hand, I might still be there now. In writing this, I am.
        
    We left the Piazza della Signoria, accepted the fact that we would walk the mile or so back to our Airbnb in soaking wet clothes along with every other person out in the streets of Florence that night. The music carried on behind us. The crowd of 200 split into clusters of twos and fours, heading to their homes or their homes-for-the-night.
          
    Still, I think that we remain a group of about 200, as I write this all the way across the world, back in California. This is what I break it all down to: these 200 or so people and I sat on the ground of the Piazza della Signoria in Florence on a hot July night listening to a high school orchestra play for free among centuries-old art, when a sudden and wild summer rainstorm opened up on us all. What all of this means to me, in the simplest terms, is that I experienced a significant moment seeing art, hearing art. I am trying to create art out of it now. I am not the only one.
     
    And for this reason, I believe that art itself is time travel, perhaps the closest we will ever get to the real thing. When you are reading a book, you can experience those written scenes as moments, over and over again. As I stood under David, and joked about him, I joined the ranks of thousands of people, tourists and travelers and Florentines who had stood in the same spot and cracked jokes, felt awe. As my friends and I sat in that crowd, and listened to that orchestra, and were soaked through to the bone by not just rain but by art all around us, we shared in a moment with other people that each one of us will look back to and think, “Yes, that was a beautiful moment.” I hope that in reading this, my friends can travel back in time to that moment. I hope that you, reading this, wherever you are and whatever art you love, can travel there with us. Let yourself sit, soak it in, let it fill you.
