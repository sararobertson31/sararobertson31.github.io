    title: `How Art Becomes Time Travel`,
    subtitle: `The Piazza della Signoria of Florence, An Orchestra, and The Rain`,
    content: `It was evening in Florence, and my three friends and I wandered through a maze of twisting streets in single-file. We had spent the day walking the city, trying and failing to book an entry slot to the Uffizi Gallery (we should have booked weeks earlier), and returning twice to a small gelato shop outside the Basilica of Santa Croce where I’d had the creamiest lemon gelato of my 22 years. Throughout our three days in Florence, I had returned countless times to the Piazza della Signoria, the public plaza outside the Palazzo Vecchio, which had housed the city’s renaissance-era government.
 
    It was not the Palazzo Vecchio that interested me as much as the collection of marble and bronze statues spread throughout the plaza. To the right of the main entrance to Palazzo Vecchio is an exact copy of Michelangelo’s David, in the exact location Michelangelo’s original David stood for centuries before he was moved into the Uffizi Gallery in 1857 to be protected from the elements (namely, pigeons). Standing in front of him, my friends and I discussed in exasperation: his hands are too big—the size of his head. How in the world could he have been considered the perfectly proportioned human form? Still, I felt drawn to David. There, in the hot muggy summer of Florence in 2022, I stood at the base of this 17 foot statue, where centuries prior, the original David had stood, and where thousands of people have stood for centuries, looking up at the same statue.
     
    There are countless other statues in the Piazza della Signoria, some copies, many originals. Most of these statues are housed in the Logia dei Lanzi, an open-air gallery facing the piazza, attached to the outside of the Uffizi Gallery. It is free to visitors, and houses most of the statues in the plaza, including Benvenuto Cellini’s original Perseus, cast in bronze in the 16th century. Perseus stands heroically over the body of Medusa, raising up her severed head as if to display it proudly to the crowd in the Piazza below. Outside the Logia dei Lanzi, around the Piazza della Signoria are a few other statues: Baccio Bandinelli’s Hercules and Cacus, aptly nicknamed by Florentines when it was first placed in the piazza “sack of potatoes,” for Hercules’s enormous, lumpy muscles; Giambologna’s Fountain of Neptune, the largest piece of work in the piazza and another victim of the ruthless Florentine nicknaming, “big white guy” for the marble statue’s extravagant details and comically exaggerated proportions.
    
    My favorite, tucked away in the corner next to the Fountain of Neptune, is a small bronze sculpture, Judith and Holofernes, cast in bronze by Donatello in the fifteenth century. Also a copy (the real one is now housed inside the Palazzo Vecchio), this statue depicts the biblical character, Judith. Living in Bethulia during the Assyrian invasion, Judith snuck into the Assyrian camp and seduced their general, Holofernes. Then, she decapitated him, saving her city from certain destruction. In this statue, Judith stands tall, gripping Holofernes’s head between her legs with her dagger raised above her head. It is the only statue in the plaza depicting both a woman and a man in which the woman has authority, is the subject rather than the object of the sculpture. Judith and Holofernes was originally placed to the left of the main entrance to Palazzo Vecchio but was moved when the male councilmembers complained. The statue is tucked away in the corner, while statues such as Perseus with the decapitated Medusa stands in the official open air gallery. 
     
    All of these statues and their history combine to create a space that expands across time; stepping into the plaza felt like stepping into the Florentine Renaissance. Crowds of people milled about, some rushing past without a second glance, some stopping and staring wide-eyed and jaw-dropped, some (like myself) returning day after day, multiple times a day. This culminated in a point in which I sat in on the ground in the center of the plaza for a few moments during my last few hours in Florence attempting to burn the space into my memory. The visual space, yes, but also the sounds, the smells, the warm breeze and the feeling of passersby rushing around me. Something about the Piazza della Signoria felt outside of time, the same now as it was a century ago and as it would be next summer and the summer after.
        
    All of this is to say, I mused over this space obsessively, trying to learn as much as I could during my three days in Florence. One of these days had faded into that warm, humid evening I began with: my friends and I wove through winding, narrow streets in a single-file line to find ourselves in the Piazza della Signoria, where a huge crowd had gathered, some sitting, others standing, all facing the Logia dei Lanzi where an orchestra had assembled. High school students, we thought, preparing to perform certainly long-practiced music for the lucky 200 or so people who happened to occupy the Piazza della Signoria at that moment. 
    
    We made our way through the crowd and found a spot to sit. The music began: a single cello player, a boy who couldn’t have been more than 17, closed his eyes and drew his bow across the strings to create a high, clear note that cast a wave of silence over a previously murmuring crowd. The violins joined in to add a dizzying harmony, then the trombones emitted a tone that seemed to warm my entire body from my stomach outward. As we sat and listened to the orchestra, the sun sank behind the buildings and cast long shadows over the piazza; warm yellow lights installed at the bases of the statues made them appear to glow against the growing moonlight. My friends and I were silent—the entire crowd was silent—as we shared in this moment, as we listened to music in a space where millions, probably billions, of people had sat or stood or walked through and listened to music, and looked with wonder at great statues, ancient or new, originals or copies, for centuries. And in a space where people will continue to do so, I hope, for centuries.
          
    They played through the sunset. Suddenly, from the night sky, I felt a single raindrop on my head. In an instant, the air was so thick with rain that I couldn’t see ten feet in front of me; still, the orchestra on the Logia dei Lanzi, sheltered from the rain by its roof, played on. I could still see the silhouette of the cellist swaying back and forth over his instrument. The crowd began to murmur again; laughter floated through the air as people stood and stuck out their hands to help up their friends sitting next to them. My friends were getting up. I saw a hand waiting for me, too, but I wanted one more moment before taking it.
        
    The rain was warm. It had soaked through my hair, my clothing. I let it; I wanted it to. I was a Californian, a stranger to warm summer rain in the 21st century. I was also a stranger to ancient and renaissance sculpture; a stranger to orchestras. I wanted every bit of that moment to soak through me: the rain, the orchestra, the statues, and everyone who had ever stood in front of them and felt so young and small in the face of something so old and so persisting. If I hadn’t taken that hand, I might still be there now. In writing this, I am.
        
    We left the Piazza della Signoria, accepted the fact that we would walk the mile or so back to our Airbnb in soaking wet clothes along with every other person out in the streets of Florence that night. The music carried on behind us. The crowd of 200 split into clusters of twos and fours, heading to their homes or their homes-for-the-night.
          
    Still, I think that we remain a group of about 200, as I write this all the way across the world, back in California. This is what I break it all down to: these 200 or so people and I sat on the ground of the Piazza della Signoria in Florence on a hot July night listening to a high school orchestra play for free among centuries-old art, when a sudden and wild summer rainstorm opened up on us all. What all of this means to me, in the simplest terms, is that I experienced a significant moment seeing art, hearing art. I am trying to create art out of it now. I am not the only one.
     
    And for this reason, I believe that art itself is time travel, perhaps the closest we will ever get to the real thing. When you are reading a book, you can experience those written scenes as moments, over and over again. As I stood under David, and joked about him, I joined the ranks of thousands of people, tourists and travelers and Florentines who had stood in the same spot and cracked jokes, felt awe. As my friends and I sat in that crowd, and listened to that orchestra, and were soaked through to the bone by not just rain but by art all around us, we shared in a moment with other people that each one of us will look back to and think, “Yes, that was a beautiful moment.” I hope that in reading this, my friends can travel back in time to that moment. I hope that you, reading this, wherever you are and whatever art you love, can travel there with us. Let yourself sit, soak it in, let it fill you.

    title: `Notes on the UAW Strike`,
    subtitle: `UC Berkeley, November 2022`,
    content: `The UAW strike would take over the UC Berkeley campus beginning on Monday, November 14th, 2023, and would continue for the next six weeks. 

Let us go back to the beginning. Strikers concentrate at every main entrance: Sather Gate and North Gate, Crescent Lawn and the intersection of Bancroft and College Avenues. Campus is otherwise empty, save for a handful of students and professors still attending class. Throughout the first week, strikers maintain an energy of obvious frustration with the administration but also an undeniable, almost breathing, air of joy and humor.

These strikers are almost all Gen Z, having newly entered the adult world. This is the first generation to grow up in a world consumed by social media, and they have used it to communicate, share media and mobilize before; the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 took over the internet like wildfire. 

Gen Z has also been ridiculed for their use of social media; some members of older generations have called it distracting, unproductive, and that the jokes and memes and trends that dominate sites like Instagram and TikTok are a nonsensical waste of time and energy.

Gen Z recognizes this mindset, but hasn’t allowed it to dissuade them from the way we use social media. Social media can be distracting and waste time, it’s true, but it can also connect people, whether it be over a silly meme that everyone knows to reference, a popular song, a dance move. It also proves indispensable in the case of mass organization; word has never spread faster, and never with so much detailed information. Before the strike began, my Instagram feed flooded with people posting and reposting where and when the strike would take place, Do’s and Don'ts, explanations of why the strike is happening and why it matters.

The influence of social media extends into the strike itself. Come Tuesday, the second day of the strike, is a somewhat funny example–but bear with me. Strikers began changing, “My neck, my back, we want a fair contract! My neck, my back, the UC is so whack!” Parodying the lyrics to a popular 2002 pop song by artist Khia, the strikers introduced modern pop culture into a chant stating why they are on strike, even adding modern slang like “whack,” meaning something disappointing, even absurd. The actual song has notably vulgar lyrics, which makes translating it into a strike chant even more inflammatory; most everybody knows the lines they’ve changed refer to genitalia. But this parodying makes it fun. It introduces silliness to an otherwise deeply serious situation. There is solidarity in the fact that this is such a popular song, using popular slang. This all establishes a sense of pride in being Gen Z. A pride in being young. It is a protest in itself against the older generation who does not take these young people seriously, as if to say, “You’re right! We are RIDICULOUS! We are vulgar, we are offensive…We are telling you what you don’t want to hear but you know it is true, and you do not want to admit that we must.”

This strike wants to be this provocative. In this kind of language, they are all but giving the finger to the administration they are striking against and anybody on it who doesn’t take them seriously for their youth or any other reason. They also want to mobilize their peers who aren’t on strike, undergraduates and other members of Gen Z.

The next Friday, the strikers hold a rally at the Campanile with speakers who express not only what they are angry about in terms of the strike, but also in terms of the wider societal atmosphere we young people find ourselves in: already expensive housing rates that only rise, an individualistic work culture, homelessness and food insecurity and a government that seems to do little to nothing about it. They take up loudspeakers to express this ever-pervading disillusionment with the world that we are inheriting, and call that we can and must change it.

The strikers march from the Campanile down College Avenue, past dorms and residential houses where students lean out of windows taking videos and waving at the marchers. The crowd begins chanting, “Join the march!” A group of students stand on their porch in their pajamas before hurrying inside one by one–then returning with shoes on. One of the official blue and white strike signs, declaring “UAW ON STRIKE: UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE,” is displayed in a dorm window, eight floors up.

Most of the strikers carry these official signs. It’s straight to the point. There is no room for interpretation. Our union of graduate student workers are on strike because we are facing unfair labor practices. The huge amount of these signs show the high degree of coordination and organization, enough that anyone who wants a sign gets one. It portrays the strikers as a solid, mobilized group that is capable of carrying on the strike for as long as they might need to, until they get the fair labor practices they demand. Many other signs identify departments. It’s a reminder that these strikers are students, and that they have a sense of pride in what they are studying, in the fields they have decided to dedicate their lives and work to. At one point, a speaker shared their gratitude for all the undergraduates striking with them. We are their students, they are our mentors. They need the undergraduate support to help demonstrate to the administration their essential role in the healthy functioning of the UC system.

The strikers are outraged. They are also joyful. They have pride in who they are and what they do. These elements shine through their high level of organization, their statements of what they are striking for, and their use of social media and popular culture in their mobilization and demonstration. The UAW strike creates a structure of feeling that reflects the broader experiences of young people coming of age in a turbulent economy and divided country. It shares widespread grievances, as well as hope that this generation is and will continue to make an impact on the world they find themselves living in.
