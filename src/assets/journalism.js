        content: `I was 21 years old, studying abroad in Paris in June 2022, when I woke up one morning to a flurry of text messages from my friends, back home in California, that the United States Supreme Court had ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade–the 1973 decision that had federally legalized abortion. With the repeal of Roe v. Wade, legal abortion was no longer a guarantee; it could be outlawed by any state that chose to do so. I was in disbelief as I walked down the streets, expecting everyone to be as outraged as I was–but nobody seemed to care. It didn’t affect them. Many of them probably didn’t even know. That day, my small cohort of other American students and I discussed in hushed tones how isolating it felt to see political turmoil that affected us so directly while the people in the space around us weren’t affected at all. I watched my friends attend protests on social media, while I felt powerless and alone across the Atlantic Ocean. 

        Since last June, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, 11 states have totally outlawed abortion, and it is highly restricted or soon to be made illegal in 14 others. Now, six states have propositions regarding abortion on their November 2022 ballots: Michigan, Vermont, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, and our very own California. Kansas’s, Kentucky’s and Montana’s measures seek abortion restrictions, while Michigan’s, Vermont’s and California’s seek to propose a constitutional amendment that would legalize abortion within the state. The reality is that with the repeal of Roe, abortion is no longer a federal issue, at least on paper. It is up to us, as Californians, to vote yes on Proposition 1, to amend our state constitution to prohibit the state government’s interference with access to legal abortion and contraceptives. 
        
        On the topic of abortion itself, the opposing arguments–pro-life or pro-choice–have a fairly straightforward and well-established dialogue. The pro-life group argues that abortion should be illegal because it takes the life of the fetus. The pro-choice group refutes this claim, stating that a fetus should not be considered a living individual to the same or any higher degree than the pregnant person. The pro-choice group also often clarifies that the issue of whether or not abortion is legal less about people actually undergoing abortions and more about people having the option to choose whether to carry their pregnancy to term or safely terminate it. People could be pro-choice and still personally choose that they do not want to have an abortion themselves; the point is, if abortion is a legal option for them, it is a choice they make for themselves.
        
        In the more abstract sense, the debate about abortion, the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the subsequent rippling out of abortion restrictions across the country follows a concerning trend of the past few years. This is a trend of political debates that are starkly established along party lines, all related to limitations over individual Americans’ access to certain “inalienable rights”: freedom to speak out, the right to vote, freedom of religion. Look to the way certain states of attempted to reduce mail-in voting, for example. Mail-in voting makes voting far more accessible, especially for working people. These restrictions tend to hit voters living on low incomes the hardest, who have less opportunity to request off time from work to go vote in-person at the poll booth. Yet those who oppose mail-in voting cry voter fraud. This claim has largely been shown to be unsupported by any concrete evidence. The research, in turn, has shown that mail-in voting restrictions tend to be about reducing the total number of people who actually vote. Restrictions are actually key in securing political power for the very people who want to restrict individuals of certain socio-economic backgrounds from voting–people who would most likely vote for their opposition. This ultimately gives politicians increased control and takes the autonomy of people who are exercising their right to vote and engage in politics. When their voices are silenced, the issues that are silencing them, like voting restrictions, only expand and silence them further.
        
        Abortion rights are similar. Restrictions often hit low-income communities the hardest. Those with enough money can get an abortion elsewhere if they live in a state where it is illegal. Those who cannot, in turn, may turn to underground, illegal abortions, which are likely to be performed in unsterile conditions and which can put the health or even the life of the pregnant person at risk. When people who cannot afford to have a legal abortion, and do not wish to assume the risks than an underground abortion would bring, find themselves in an incredibly difficult situation. The foster care system is already overloaded. Families who keep the child may struggle to financially support their family, especially when they already have multiple children. And when people are constantly working to try to support themselves and their family, they have even less time and energy to engage in politics. Abortion restrictions are nothing other than another attempt at silencing people and implementing extreme control over individual Americans.
        
        The appearance of Prop 1 on the California ballot this November, and similar issues in Michigan and Vermont, sow how we can use the autonomy our vote provides us to secure further autonomy in legally protecting access to safe abortion. It’s all connected; if the right to choose whether or not have an abortion is no longer protected, there’s no saying how far the repeal of certain rights pertaining to individual liberty could do. We see this, too, in the fight over mail-in voting, in gerrymandering. These, along with abortion, are connected ultimately as attempts to silence people and give lawmakers a disproportionate amount of control over an individual’s choices that relate nothing more to their own livelihood.
        
        We won’t let it go that far. The Supreme Court decision is terrifying, for me and my peers as college students and young professionals just beginning our lives. I can’t imagine how other members of our generation must feel across the country, especially where abortion is mostly or completely restricted. I imagine that sense of powerlessness and isolation I felt along with my American peers in paris last summer is prevalent in those people especially. But that isolation actually didn’t last for those of us in Paris; a few days after the news came out, Parisians themselves were participating in demonstrations to show their condemnation of the U.S. Supreme Court decision. We are not powerless or isolated, and we will not allow legal decisions intend to silence us stand.
        
        Advocacy works. The appearance of Prop 1 on the California ballot shows that. The outrage at the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade put enough pressure on the governments of California, Michigan and Vermont to include protections of abortion’s legal status on their ballots, giving people the ability to exercise their voice and autonomy through their vote. The stakes are high, but we have the power to move them in favor of our individual freedom. Let California set an example for the rest of the United States, and the rest of the world. Their eyes are on us, and the ballot is in our hands.`,
