My mission is to create work that tells stories about authentic human experiences and inspires people to be more open and connected with the world around them. Whether through poetry or storytelling—creative or journalistic—I believe that writing holds a special power to ignite empathy. When you read, you inhabit another's mind. Writing certainly is my passion, but I also believe it is both the source and product of my greatest strength.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English and a minor in history in 2023. I have been working in journalism since 2023, and writing since I could hold a pen.
