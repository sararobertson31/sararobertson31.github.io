    content: `my mouth is all full of petals,
    and Oh how they drape their
    bitter bodies over my tongue!
    Squinting against the sun 
    plummeting down all over 
    my face in throbbing beams, 
    I feel perspiration rolling like 
    enormous pearls into the concave 
    of my chest. They sink into a 
    puddle, and I know that beneath 
    the puddle are miles of tunnels 
    which are dark and warm
    and narrow, 
    
    Is this what Eve felt
    when she tasted that
    sweet, forbidden?
     
    All around me I see walls
    filled up with butterflies,
    crucified, on pins.
     
    Their wings outstretched
    towards that unforgiving sun,
    like little petals, wasted paperthin.
     
    Ghosts of butterflies tumble
    through the tunnels in my body,
    getting caught and slashing
    claustrophobic walls with
    the edges of frantic wings.
    Oh, how I wish I could
    reach in through the soft
    damp skin of my stomach
    and stretch out this inside
    part end to end.
    I would paint it all over the page,
    and I would let the butterflies go,
    and maybe then my teeth
    wouldnâ€™t bleed broken syllables
    and I could lay in the grass
    and make angels in the dirt.
